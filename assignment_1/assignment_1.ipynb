    "*Keep in mind, that while VGG16 and other CNN's you have implemented so far, only incoporate convolutions and pooling layers, many state-of-the-art models  use a variety of other techniques, such as skip connections (CITATION NEEDED), or self-attention (CITATION NEEDED) to get better results.*\n",

That might sound vague, but just imagine that some other poor sod will have to read your code at some point, and easily readable, understandable code, will go a long way to making their life easier. However, this is not a coding course, so the main focus should of course be on the exercises themselves.*\n",
